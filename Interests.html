<p style="color:white;"  style="font-size:20px;" align="Middle"> Truly a terrific tourist destination, Venice was an incredible choice due to its rich history. There was so much to do and a beautiful, surreal town. Sightseeing alone could fill a tourists needs for life!.One of the most incredible sights i have ever seen is St Mark's Basilica. One can simply not enjoy Venice enough and i wish to return.</p>
